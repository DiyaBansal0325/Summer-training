This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the \\\"Adult\\\" section. OK?<br /><br />I can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better and productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof teabags or whatever.<br /><br />2/10\",\n          \"Guest from the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, battle of good and evil -- all with a small budget, child actors, and few special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(hmm, i wonder if this is where james cameron got the idea for terminator...) who gets to nick -- and mielophone -- first? excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. i wish hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"national treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates (how precious is that, i ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the united states founding fathers. after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like indiana jones meets the patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'stanley goodspeed' regurgitation of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />the relevancy and logic to having george washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout u.s. currency art work, is something that director jon turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. couldn't washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. he's set on protecting the treasure. for who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />but there are a few problems with ben's crusade. first up, his friend, ian holmes (sean bean) decides that he can't wait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the declaration of independence from the national archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. so ian tries to kill ben. the assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. it also affords ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, abigail chase (diane kruger). she thinks ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. but true to action/romance form, abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the hope diamond?\\\" the film moves into full x-file-ish mode, as the fbi, mistakenly believing that ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive. honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? in the final analysis, \\\"national treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make il' betsy ross blush.<br /><br />the buena vista dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. the stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. the audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. if only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

that are shot during the daytime. it doesn't matter what the location is. at an important conference in the white house, no lights are on, and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows. the primier of china conducts an earth-shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of homer in a rembrandt painting. honest. it's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness. the slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill-thought-out movie.roy scheider and maria conchita alonzo do well by their roles, but scheider is rarely on screen. the other performances are dismissable. there is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a bond movie who's accent suggests a childhood spent in basset, nebraska, and who should have remained the model she probably started out as. whoever plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like johnny depp, not because of any display of talent. the chinese villains, representing both taiwan and mainland china, hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes. the script is pretty awful, recycled from other, better films. there is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat. two thirds of the way through, the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs. then the movie splits into two related parts. part one, another shootout, this time in a waterfront warehouse. part two, an exchange between the vice president, now acting president, and the oily chinese premiere, lifted out of both \\\"dr. strangelove\\\" and \\\"fail safe.\\\" we unwittingly launch our missiles. they launch theirs in retaliation. we cannot convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. there is even the george c. scott/ walter matthau general who argues that their \\\"nucular\\\" armory can't match ours so we should hit them with everything we've got. more fireballs. the end comes none too soon.\",\n          \"in sri lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-sinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek, winner of several awards at the national film awards in india. while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka. played with deep feeling and expressiveness by p.s. keerthana in a memorable performance, amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama (nandita das) and dileepan (j.d. chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a red cross camp. in a loving flashback, we see amudha's adoptive parents, father thiru (madhavan) a prominent tamil writer, and mother indra (simran) a tv personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. while she is playing, thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that \\\"you are not our daughter\\\" and the response is predictable. distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the tamil separatists. the family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a. r. rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich\\u00e9d and commercial, yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.\",\n          \"futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s (the origins of off off broadway). though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution. the story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. on the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in america.the stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the u.s. and europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, tom o'horgan (who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway).this is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget. and it just might change the way you see the world...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
